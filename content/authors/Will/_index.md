I am a Research Associate at the University of Manchester. My research applies machine learning methods to understand transcriptional regulation in the context of drosophila development. I am curently working on time aware representation learning for single cell data and modelling translation. 

During my PhD my research investigated repressive DNA elements in Oesophageal Adenocarcinoma and developed a computationally efficient non-negative matrix factorisation method method for analysis of paired single cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility data.
