I am a PhD student in Bioinformatics at the University of Manchester, 
part of the ELLIS PhD programme, working in collaboration with AstraZeneca. 
My research focuses on integrating machine learning and statistical methods for spatial multi-omic analysis.

I hold an MSc in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology from Gebze Technical University and a BSc in Molecular Biology and Genetics from Istanbul Medeniyet University. My expertise includes genomics, spatial omics, and structural biology, and I am proficient in multiple programming languages for large-scale bioinformatics data analysis. My work has contributed to algorithm development for viral surveillance, drug discovery, and sustainable agriculture, leading to multiple high-impact publications in journals like Nature Biotechnology and Briefings in Bioinformatics.

I am an Executive Board Member of the Asia Pacific Bioinformatics Network (APBioNET) and actively contribute to bioinformatics education and training. I co-authored the Grand Challenges in Bioinformatics Education and Training paper and regularly serve as a coordinator and trainer for global initiatives. I am committed to advancing the field through scientific contributions, education, and community-driven initiatives.
