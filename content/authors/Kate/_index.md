I am a Research Associate at the University of Manchester. My research focuses on metabolic modelling of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells to predict avenues for culture optimisation. I also maintain an interest in cancer metabolism and metabolic modelling across different organisms. 

Currently, I am funded by a Prosperity Partnership with FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies UK.
