I am a PhD student in Health Informatics at the University of Manchester, as part of the Health Data Research UK (HDRUK) PhD Programme on Health Data Science. My research aims at improving existing clinical prognosis standards on hard-to-detect clinical events with machine learning algorithms on clinical longitudinal data. I work with data from a wide range of biological disciplines, ranging from clustered clinical longitudinal data to bioinformatics metadata, in R and Python. 

I obtained a BSc in Natural Sciences specialising in Genetics, Evolution and Environment and Mathematics and Statistics at UCL followed by a MSc in Medical Statistics. Before joining this PhD programme I have worked with Berry Oncology (Beijing) and Southern Technology University Hospital to improving existing standards of liver cell cancer prognosis in the Chinese population. 

Outside my PhD daily routine, I am an active scuba diver of Global Underwater Explorers (GUE) and am working towards technical diving qualifications. My other interests include freediving/breath-hold swimming, hiking, European Medieval history and literatures from H. P. Lovecraft.
